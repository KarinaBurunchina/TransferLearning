Transfer learning on the datasets with Children. Used datasets: PInSoRo and Qamqor. Engagement recognition.
PInSoRo dataset was found on Internet. Qamqor (dataset on robot-child engagement with autistic children) is provided by Anara Sandygulova (Assistant Professor at Nazarbayev University).

The PInSoRo dataset was divided into 3 groups: child-robot, child-child, and both engagements. Then the model based on Neural Networks was developed. The knowledge was transferred into the new model for Qamqor dataset to imrove its performance.
